Game Overview


The game I hope to create will be a clone/theme-clone of the game known as Contra (nes). 


UI  
The games user interface will be as closely resembled to the original game as possible with a few possible additions or removals where I see fit. The original UI style of the game embedded the scoring system and live counter into the edges of the playing field.

Development Strategy        

Alex - will focus on the networking side of things as well as level design
Daniil - will focus on animations / collisions and game logic. Ie making the game work.




Sticking Points  
One of the biggest challenges I can foresee with this game is its sheer amount of enemies as well as the ability to control the player in many directions including the jumping animation and the laying in prose ability.
